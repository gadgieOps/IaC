# Test/Development Environmet - IaC

## Overview

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations for managing a ephemeral environment that I use as a test & development environment for my personal learning goals. The goal is to maintain a reliable, efficient, and secure environment through code-driven infrastructure management. This environment is fully ephemeral and is routinely recycled.

## Philosophy

### Continuous Improvement

This code and underlying systems embrace the philosophy of continuous improvement. The code and configurations here are not static but evolve as knowledge and technologies advance.

### Security-First Mindset

I strive to implement security best practices throughout all configurations. However, security is a collaborative effort that benefits from many perspectives.

## Feedback and Contributions

Your feedback is invaluable, especially regarding potential security vulnerabilities or improvements. If you discover any security concerns or have suggestions, please open an issue.
